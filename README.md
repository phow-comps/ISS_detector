# ISS_detector
Ok First Competition:

This One Will Be More Of A Test Run, and not very informative, i.e. not much insight provided.

We Might Add a Participant Reaction Role In The Future, which you can get by expressing interest in future competitons.

So this one's pretty basic:

Given this api: http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json
And the allowed modules being pandas , requests and plotly, make an International Space Station(ISS) detector program. 

The code needs to be your own, and fully commented. No searching up on the internet, that will result in reduction of points and/or reps.

The program requirements are as follows:
1) The program needs to be your own code, no copy pasting
2) It needs to be fully commented, line by line
3) The program will make a call to this address: http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json 
4) It will get the ISS's live coordinates. 
5) It will then plot those coordinates on a map using the plotly module
6) The plotted location needs to be ISS's live location only


Hints in case you want them:
1) Think about the ways you can read data using pandas and manipulate it(The default data is in a wrong format, and is unreadable by plotly:) )
2) The final code is only 10-15 lines 

You can install the respective modules by typing the following inside your terminal or cmd:

pip install pandas
pip install requests
pip install plotly plotly

And Also, the winners will get the @deleted-role role!

You have exactly 1 week from now, Send through your code to @Gaurav when finished, it will then be tested, and the first two successful submissions will be given the @deleted-role role

Good Luck!
